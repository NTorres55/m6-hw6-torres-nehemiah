## Issues:
Only issue I had was watching the wrong recording. I added code and commited with lecture recording, then had to start over. With new code.

## I used the following outside resources:

1. For transitions - [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp )
2. How to add apostrophe without ending string - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6257619/how-get-an-apostrophe-in-a-string-in-javascript)
3. And recorded lectures and notes from class.
